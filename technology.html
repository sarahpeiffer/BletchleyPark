        <h4>Code and Cipher Breaking</h4>
        Breaking German Lorenz ciphers is an integral part of the war effort.  <span class="bletchley">bletchley.</span> developed "Newmanry" machines designed to mechanise the process. 
        These machines led to the development of the groundbreaking Colossus machine, the world's first semi-programmable machine. 
        These codebreaking efforts give government and military officials unprecendented knowledge about German defences and command communications.
