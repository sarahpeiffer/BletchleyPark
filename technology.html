        <h4>Code and Cipher Breaking</h4>
        Here at <span class="bletchley">bletchley.</span>, codebreaking is at the heart of what we do. From using bombes to break the Enigma code to processing high levels of signals intelligence every day, we are proud to have such an important role in the war. 
        Breaking German Lorenz ciphers is an integral part of the war effort.  <span class="bletchley">bletchley.</span> developed "Newmanry" machines designed to mechanise the process. 
        These machines led to the development of the groundbreaking Colossus machine, the world's first semi-programmable machine. 
        These codebreaking efforts give government and military officials unprecendented knowledge about German defenses and command communications.

                <h3>Bombe</h3>
                Bombes are used to break the German Enigma code.  Women at <span class="bletchley">bletchley.</span> comprise a large portion of the team working with bombes. 
                <br>
                A bombe is comprised of 100 rotating drums, 10 miles of wire, and about 1 million soldered connections.

        <h3>Impacts of our Technology</h3>
        We are proud that our diverse workforce and female-driven community is able to participate in such groundbreaking war efforts. While they may not be aware of it, the work these women 
        conduct at <span class="bletchley">bletchley.</span> aids the Allies in carrying out bombing campaigns more successfully! While team members at <span class="bletchley">bletchley.</span> are not 
        involved in any military decision making, they carry out their duties silently and efficiently.
