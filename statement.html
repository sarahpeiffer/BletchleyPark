            The modern technology industry is overflowing with startups, new ideas, and yet another company vowing to single handedly solve gender bias in tech with vague diversity initiatives.  The push to include women in modern computing assumes a landscape of technology that was shaped by and for men.  While recent initiatives to increase gender diversity in the industry are much needed, they exist due to the erasure of women who historically comprised a large portion of the field.  There are countless historical examples of women working at the forefront of technical innovation, including the women of Bletchley Park who highlight both the work of women and their subsequent erasure.  Codebreaking work at Bletchley Park was essential to the war effort and about 75% of the workforce was women.   However the women were forced to remain silent about their work, and “many did not even realize that they were engaged in a codebreaking operation at all”.  The modern narrative of “tech bros'' and the pervasive male dominated coding culture is rooted in a recorded history of primarily male success in science and technology. This imbalance goes beyond history and into the present, as in 2019, 20% of the computing workforce was made up of women, a fraction that has been steadily decreasing from 29% in 1998.   While it may seem as though this historical erasure has little to do with the present day, the gender landscape of modern computing is built on assumptions of the past that marginalize a large portion of the community.

            The work of these women was diminished due to the need for secrecy surrounding the war effort and societal stereotypes surrounding their work.  To bring them back into the public consciousness, “bletchley.” frames the work and women of Bletchley Park within a company website mimicking a modern tech startup.  By bringing their accomplishments into a format that is modern and understandable to many, “bletchley.” challenges the lack of focus on history and the tendency to view historical figures as unrelated to our current lives.  This piece utilizes parody to center the work in the world of tech today while critiquing the status quo of the industry, beyond gender disparity. By creating this art using modern technology, it brings “older” tech into the modern era and roots the rhetoric in the subject it is analyzing.  “bletchley.” attempts to call into question what the modern tech industry views as a model of success and the blueprint of the hyper successful, hyper masculine engineer.  For many, history is a boring, black and white discussion of people and events that have little relevance to modern life.  By framing the history of Bletchley Park in a modern and satirical context, “bletchley.” brings the past into the present and encourages consideration of why these stories were left in the past in the first place.
