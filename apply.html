        <h3>Diversity and Inclusion</h3>
        We are proud to have made great strides in our diversity initiatives.  Here at <span class="bletchley">bletchley.</span>, roughly 25% of our coders identify as male.  We recognize that we still have great strides to make to reach the national workplace average of 80% male programmers. 
        However, we are confident that our progress is on a forward momentum and the below plans will help <span class="bletchley">bletchley.</span> reach our vague diversity goals by 2070. 
        <div class="initiative">
            Greater visibility of current male <span class="bletchley">bletchley.</span> programmers in our recruiting efforts and on our site.
